    What is Responsive?

    Responsive means that a website can automatically adjust its layout,
    content, and design to look good on all screen sizes â€” like phones,
    tablets, laptops, and big monitors.

    A responsive website makes sure that users have a good experience
    no matter what device they are using.

    Text gets smaller on small screens, images resize, and elements
    can move or stack to fit the space nicely.

    In short: Responsive = flexible and screen-friendly.
