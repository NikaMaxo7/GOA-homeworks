        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>We are a team of automotive art enthusiasts who create a virtual space — where a car is not just transportation, but also style, history, and technology.</p>
        <p>Our gallery is designed to bring together classic legends, modern supercars, and concept models of the future on one platform.</p>
        <p>Here you will find the most famous brands in the world — BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi and more. Each car is selected for its special characteristics — speed, design, rarity or history.</p>
        <p>Behind this project is enthusiasm, love for cars, and the desire to create a visually beautiful and informative website.</p>
        <p>We are working on constant updates — new brands, models, and sections will be added to the gallery: sports cars, concepts, SUVs, and rare specimens.</p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting our gallery. We hope you will be impressed and will definitely come back again!</p>
