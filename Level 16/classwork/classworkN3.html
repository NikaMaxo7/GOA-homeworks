    <em>goa stands for goal-oriented-academy</em>
    I have many skills, but there is one thing I do best. It is analyzing reality. I observe the
    world and put together a puzzle called <strong>"My Life"</strong>.
    "They" don't want you to <em>have your children educated.</em> "They" don't want you to think much about reality.
    That is why your life and environment are filled with entertainment,
    mass media, memes, hot trends, game shows, television programs, alcohol,
    drugs and any kind of hedonistic activity that temporarily
    enjoys the human brain in an illusion of happiness and forgets what reality is like.
    It is easy to manage people who spend most of their time thinking
    about which team will win the football championship.
    Whether Argentina wins or Spain will change your life in almost no way.
    <strong>Do only those activities that bring you change</strong> (bad change is also experience and a necessary prerequisite for growth) and will move you forward financially/intellectually.
    While you are wasting your time on entertainment, smart people are learning,
    working, developing, and taking your place.
