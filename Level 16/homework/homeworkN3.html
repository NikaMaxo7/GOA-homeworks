            <b>Leonardo da Vinci</b> (1452-1519) was one of the greatest <em>inventors</em>, <em>artists</em>, <em>scientists</em>, and <em>engineers</em> of the Italian Renaissance. <br> His most famous works are the <em>Mona Lisa</em> and <em>The Last Supper</em>, which are irreplaceable in the history of art. <br> Da Vinci created sketches of flying machines, tanks, anatomical drawings, and many other inventions, <br> which are considered the forerunners of modern science and technology. <br> He studied the human body in detail and created accurate anatomical drawings that are still used today. <br> Many of his ideas were unprepared for practical use at the time, <br> but later technological progress made them possible. <br> Da Vinci left behind numerous cryptic notes in which he studied science, art, and engineering. <br> He is considered a universal genius whose ideas were centuries ahead of his time.
