    Inline CSS ->Its written in the style directly inside the HTML tag using the "style" attribute.
    It's useful for quick tests, but not recommended for big projects.

    Internal ->Its written inside the <style> tag in the <head> part of my HTML file. 
    It affects the elements in this page. I usually use this when I want to style a single page.

    External ->its written in another file and is connected with link tag using <link>. It's good for big projects with many pages. 
    (for example: "styles.css"). In my opinion, it's the best way to use CSS because it keeps HTML clean.
