    Block and Inline explained

    Block: behaves like a big box. Always starts on a new line and by default
    takes the full width of its container. You can set width, height, margin, and padding freely.

    Inline: behaves like text. Stays in the same line with surrounding text.
    Only takes as much space as needed by its content. 
    Width/height donâ€™t apply the same way, and vertical margin/padding have limited effect.
