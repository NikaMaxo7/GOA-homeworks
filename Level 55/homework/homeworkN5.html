    <div class="display-block">Block</div>

    <div class="display-inline">Inline</div>

    <div class="display-inline-block">Inline-Block</div>

    <!--

    Explanation:

    - Block elements always start on a new line and take the full width available.

    - Inline elements stay in the same line and are only as wide as their content.
        They do not respect width/height settings.

    - Inline-block elements stay in the same line (like inline), 
        but they allow me to set width and height (like block).
        So inline-block is a mix of both.
