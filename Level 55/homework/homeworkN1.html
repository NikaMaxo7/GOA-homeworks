    <!--
    Box Model explanation:

    The box model is like a package for every HTML element.
    It has 4 main parts:

    1) Content: The actual text, image, or other element inside the box.
    2) Padding: The inner space between the content and the border.
    3) Border: The visible line or frame that goes around the padding and content.
    4) Margin: The outer space outside the border, which separates the element from other elements.

    So margin is outside, padding is inside, and border is the line in the middle.
